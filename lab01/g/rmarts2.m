%% this is a very preliminar way to try to discard artifacts that resemble ripple events. In order to avoid discarding actual ripples, the code discards events only when they occur in a non-physiological frequency (finding >=5 ripples in one second is very rare, even more if the interval between ripples is constant), or if the ripple has a very outlier amplitude
% once you set universal thresholds, the idea is to transform this ugly code into a matlab function

Moreover, events with very outlier amplitudes should be discarded even if it is a single event.
